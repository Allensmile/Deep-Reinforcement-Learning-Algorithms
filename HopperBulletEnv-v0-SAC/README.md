# Project - HopperBulletEnv with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

### Environment  

Solving the environment require an average total reward of over **2500** on 100 consecutive episodes.    
Training of HopperBulletEnv is performed using the __Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)__ algorithm, see    
two basic papers [SAC: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep RL with a Stochastic Actor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290)     
and [SAC Algorithms and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905).  We solve the HopperBulletEnv environment in **7662 episodes**.
