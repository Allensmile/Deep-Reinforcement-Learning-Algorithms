# Project - AntBulletEnv with Soft Actor Critic (SAC)

### Introduction

Solving the environment require an average total reward of over 2500 over 100 consecutive episodes.   
We solve the environment  by usage of the __SAC__ algorithm, see the basic paper [SAC: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep RL with a Stochastic Actor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290/).

### Learning Curve

The threshold score **2500** was achived in the episode **1811**  after training **24 hours**.
